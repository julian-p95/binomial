# binomial

The code is a simulation of the number of coupon books sold by 25 people in a given time period. The coupon books contain 50 coupons each, and the probability of selling a coupon book is calculated as 40529/150000. The simulation is done using the binomial distribution and the scipy.stats library. The results of the simulation are compared with the theoretical values calculated from the binomial distribution. The comparison is visualized using a bar graph. The probability of selling 0 coupon books is also calculated and displayed.
